The Solaris/x86 image is built with GCC 2.8.1, and must be dynamically
linked against GNU's libstdc++.so.2.8.1 in order to work. We've
included the library in this tarball, and you should ensure that
either:

 - the library is in the same directory as the client, or
 - you set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the
   directory containing the library
