RC5DES v2.7024.409 Client  6/16/98

This program is a port of the Unix version, and is run as in Unix, using the Terminal application.  Documentation on how to use the rc5des command is available at http://rc5.distributed.net/FAQ/rc5v2-help.html/.  Also, see the included file rc5des.txt.

This version supports both the RC5 and DES contests.  Currently there is no DES contest, and RC5 keys will always be processed.  The client will automatically switch to a DES contest when one begins.

This version supports multiple CPUs, and also sets thread priorities using the "niceness" configuration setting.  The niceness settings of 0, 1, and 2 correspond to thread priorities of 5, 7, and 10.

Future plans for the BeOS version include making it into a standalone program and providing a full user interface.
