 Welcome to the new RC5-DES (Project Bovine/Project Monarch) Client.

    1.0  Getting started
    2.0  *nix specific notes
    3.0  Help! 
   
 1.0  Getting started ------------------------------------------------
 
    Just unpack/unzip/untar the client in a directory of your choice and 
    fire it up with [path]rc5des

    If you have never run the client before, it will initiate the
    menu-driven configuration. Save and quit when done, the configuration
    file will be saved in_the_same_directory_as_the_client. Then, simply 
    restart the client. From that point on it will use the saved 
    configuration.
    
    The configuration options are fairly self-explanatory and can be run
    at any time by starting the client with the '-config' option.
    A list of command line options is available by starting the client 
    with '-help' or '--help'.

    A "Complete Step-by-Step Guide to Running Your First Client" is 
    available at http://distributed.net/FAQ/

 2.0  Notes: ---------------------------------------------------------

    Beginning with v2.7101, the client's default directory is the 
    one the configuration file is located in, which in turn is assumed to
    be in the same directory the binary is in. To specify another 
    configuration file use the -ini switch.
    
    Beginning with v2.7102, multi-threaded clients can be forced to run
    single-threaded by setting the number of CPUs (the numcpu= option in
    the configuration file or the -numcpu switch on the command line) to
    zero.
    
    Also beginning with v2.7102, the restriction on the number of processors
    has been lifted. The client will run with as many processors as are
    available (the client will attempt autodetection if numcpu is -1). If
    your client does not support processor or processor-count autodetection
    and you know how to accomplish this on your platform send a code snippet 
    to <coders@distributed.net>

    Also (herewith officially) beginning with v2.7102, the client is always
    nohup'able. Sensibly enough, -HUP causes a restart. Beginning with this 
    release, *nix'ish clients also support -hide/-quiet mode. User level
    '>/dev/null &' is deprecated, since it does not allow the client to warn
    the user when it fails to start. With -hide/-quiet you can be sure that
    the client has started successfully if you do not get a message to the
    contrary. 
    
    As of November 7th, 1998, much of the client source, including all the 
    core crunch code that was previously scattered about, is available 
    online at http://www.distributed.net/source/  All the above mentioned 
    changes in 2.7102 were submitted by Cyrus Patel <cyp@fb14.uni-mainz.de>

 3.0  Help: ----------------------------------------------------------

    An immediate source of help is the IRC channel on EFnet. The 
    #distributed channel is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

    the the list of "Frequently asked Questions" (FAQs) available online 
    at http://www.distributed.net/FAQ/ Documents cover every aspect of 
    running a client including "The Complete Step by Step Guide to 
    Running Your First Client", "How To Join A Team", and the popular

    If you believe you have found a bug in the client or would like to
    make a suggestion, please send a message to the coders at 
    <coders@lists.distributed.net>. Don't forget to specify which platform 
    you are running the client on. 
    
    If you believe you have found a bug specific to this port, or would
    like to make a suggestion specific to this port, send a message to the 
    port maintainer as listed on http://www.distributed.net/credits.html
    Don't fret if you don't get a response right away.
