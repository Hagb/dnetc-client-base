 Welcome to the RC5-DES (Project Bovine/Project Monarch) client.

 This document covers information specific to the client for *ix.
 Refer to the enclosed rc5des.txt or browse the online FAQ at
 http://www.distributed.net/FAQ for non-platform-specific documentation.

    1.0  Getting started
    2.0  *ix specific notes
   
 1.0  Getting started ------------------------------------------------
 
    Just unpack/unzip/untar the client in a directory of your choice and 
    fire it up with [path]rc5des

    If you have never run the client before, it will initiate the
    menu-driven configuration. Save and quit when done. If the client
    was started with an explicit path specifier, eg './there/rc5des',
    then the configuration file will be saved ./there/. Otherwise, it 
    will be saved in the current directory.

    Then, simply restart the client. From that point on it will use the 
    saved configuration.
    
    The configuration options are fairly self-explanatory and can be run
    at any time by starting the client with the '-config' option.
    A list of command line options is available by starting the client 
    with '-help' or '--help'.

    A "Complete Step-by-Step Guide to Running Your First Client" is 
    available at http://distributed.net/FAQ/

 2.0  Notes: ---------------------------------------------------------

    Beginning with v2.7101, the client's default directory is the 
    one the configuration file is located in, which in turn is assumed to
    be in the same directory the binary is in (if the binary was started
    with an explicit path spec). To specify another configuration file 
    use the -ini switch.
    
    Beginning with v2.7102, multi-threaded clients can be forced to run
    single-threaded by setting the number of CPUs (the numcpu= option in
    the configuration file or the -numcpu switch on the command line) to
    zero.
    
    Also beginning with v2.7102, the restriction on the number of processors
    has been lifted. The client will run with as many processors as are
    available (the client will attempt autodetection if numcpu is -1). If
    your client does not support processor or processor-count autodetection
    and you know how to accomplish this on your platform send a code snippet 
    to <coders@distributed.net>

    Also (herewith officially) beginning with v2.7102, the client is always
    nohup'able. Sensibly enough, -HUP causes a restart. Beginning with this 
    release, *nix'ish clients also support -hide/-quiet mode. User level
    '>/dev/null &' is deprecated, since it does not allow the client to warn
    the user when it fails to start. With -hide/-quiet you can be sure that
    the client has started successfully if you do not get a message to the
    contrary. 
    
    Beginning with v2.7110.442, the process name (as seen from ps or top) is 
    always 'rc5des'. This is to facilitate scripted or system-wide --pause, 
    --unpause, --shutdown and --restart
    
    As of November 7th, 1998, much of the client source, including all the 
    core crunch code that was previously scattered about, is available 
    online at http://www.distributed.net/source/
