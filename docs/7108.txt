Congratulations!  You have just downloaded a 2.7108 client, complete with 
large block support!

What this means:

The limit on the size of blocks the client is able to process has now been
raised from 2^32-1 up to 2^64-1 keys.  As a result, you will now be able
to request blocks larger than 2^31 from keyservers.  At current, the
largest block size a client will request is 2^33.

We encourage you to use the block size recommended by the client's
internal benchmark to reduce load on our network.

2.7108 clients are able to read buffer files from older clients just fine
(full fetching/flushing capability), however older clients are not able to
read 2.7108 buffers _at all_.  2.7108 clients can also only communicate
with 300 series or above proxies.  As a result, if you are going to
upgrade an installation where buffer files are shared, you must upgrade
all clients at one time!

However, if you are simply updating an installation that is standalone,
no action is required on your part, the client will load up your old
buffer files and start crunching away.
