  Should a -detach option be made to make forked executions easier?
  It would probably set quiet mode, fork, close fd's 0,1,2, and reattach
  them all to /dev/null and then call setsid().  It might also be
  desirable to perform the functionality of "nohup" and ignore all other
  signals?  Maybe a -detachnohup or something to do this?

  A user reported: (note this occurs under the gui clients where
  client member functions may be run many times, so it's likely that
  some variable isn't getting rezeroed at the start of the benchmark
  function):

  I noticed when you run a benchmark after the client has been running
  it displays the total number of blocks completed and the key rate
  instead of the actual benchmark results.

  Selecting Intel Pentium, Intel Pentium MMX, Cyrix 5x86 code
  Benchmarking RC5 with 10000000 tests:
  .....10%.....20%.....30%.....40%.....50%.....60%.....70%...(etc)...100
  Completed 5 RC5 Blocks 0.00:32:15.64 - [559887.82 keys/s]

  Suggestion: A user reported: the send and recieve messages seem
  rather redundent.  For both send and recieve there is the proxy
  message.  Thats fine once, for the revieve say, but then gets
  redundent for the send.  Also, it first tells you that it "Retrieved
  block 1 of 1 (100.00% transferred)" and then tells you "Retrieved 1
  RC5 block(s) from server" One of these messages is nice, but two gets
  cluttering.

  New Bug: Run the client offline, with contestdone2 set to 1, and
           nothing in the input buffer. Instead of generating a random
           block it starts processing a garbage block (often 400%
           complete!). Doesn't happen if contestdone2=0.

  New Suggestion: A/C power checking on the Win32 clients.  Some users
  run their client on their battery powered laptops and would like the
  client to only be working when they are connected to A/C.

  New Suggestion: some of the files produced by the client are still
  not made "fully qualified" by the Client::InternalGetLocalFilename()
  function.  The checkpoint files are this way.  On startup, if a
  filename is not a fully qualified filename (doesn't contain any '\'
  or '/' or start with a drive specifier), then the filename should be
  made into a fully qualified local file by using the above function.
Addendum (silby):  Logfiles appear to be this way too.
Addendum (silby):  I'll fix this soon, working on it now.

  New Bug: Some parts of the program (mail.cpp in particular) print stuff
           irrespective of the quietmode setting.

  New Suggestion: Would it not be a good idea to move the number of CPUs
                  option to menu 1, next to the CPU-type setting? It's
                  definitely one of the main settings, and I know menu 4
                  was the last place I looked for it when setting 7022 up
                  on by dual-PII box for the first time.
  Fixed: Both options now on a Performance Options menu

  New Bug: In 407+ (406?) a call to client.WriteConfig() overwrites the
           .ini file with parameters given on the command line. This
           is probably not the expected behaviour, at least from the 
           user point of view.
  Comments: (Silby) I'll look into this. It appears that this *only*
            occurs when the contest switches or the random keyspace
            changes. Fixing it should not be tough.
  More Comments: (Silby) This isn't new, actually. It's just more obvious
                 because I have more options in there. I'll make a new
                 procedure that only updates the randomprefix and
                 contest status.
  FIXED: (Silby) Ok, I added a new function (WriteContestandPrefixConfig).
         It only writes the randomprefix and contestdone settings to the
         file (making sure to load fresh from the .ini first.) I then
         changed all the calls to writeconfig aside from two to
         WriteContestandPrefixConfig. This appears to fix the bug for me.
         (If it does not, please comment, of course.)

  FIXED!!: Between 403 and 406, there is a drop of almost 50k keys/sec on my
           K6-200 using the same CPU core. I've tried taking out the new
           CLI code and playing with the link order with no avail. Me and Daa
           are guessing that it could be the new timing code.
  NOTE:    It seems that when the stack size is 32k instead of 16k it slows
           down the client. Probably affects the variable look ups in the
           rc5 cores, since it doesn't affect the DES core.
           In addition, it solved the problem of why the k6 core was running
           slower then the p6 core on a K6. It was all in the stack.

  FIXED!!: The X key no longer works on Watcom compiles. It will display the
           message that it will quit after the next block is completed but,
           it just keeps going.
