5-31-98 - Oscar Chang
  New Bug: Between 403 and 406, there is a drop of almost 50k keys/sec on my
           K6-200 using the same CPU core. I've tried taking out the new
           CLI code and playing with the link order with no avail. Me and Daa
           are guessing that it could be the new timing code.
  FIXED!!: The X key no longer works on Watcom compiles. It will display the
           message that it will quit after the next block is completed but,
           it just keeps going.
