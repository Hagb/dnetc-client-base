6-01-98 - Remi Guyomarch
  New Bug: In 407+ (406?) a call to client.WriteConfig() overwrites the
           .ini file with parameters given on the command line. This
           is probably not the expected behaviour, at least from the 
           user point of view.
  Comments: (Silby) I'll look into this. It appears that this *only*
            occurs when the contest switches or the random keyspace
            changes. Fixing it should not be tough.
  More Comments: (Silby) This isn't new, actually. It's just more obvious
                 because I have more options in there. I'll make a new
                 procedure that only updates the randomprefix and
                 contest status.


5-31-98 - Oscar Chang
  New Bug: Between 403 and 406, there is a drop of almost 50k keys/sec on my
           K6-200 using the same CPU core. I've tried taking out the new
           CLI code and playing with the link order with no avail. Me and Daa
           are guessing that it could be the new timing code.
  FIXED!!: The X key no longer works on Watcom compiles. It will display the
           message that it will quit after the next block is completed but,
           it just keeps going.
