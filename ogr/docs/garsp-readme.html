  GARSP versus GVANT
</H2>
<P>
GARSP was designed as a replacement for the GVANT program to search for Optimal
Golomb Rulers. &nbsp;As such, it is prudent to first discuss the differences
between the two.

  Getting Started
</H2>
<P>
You need to have downloaded or otherwise recreated the choose.dat file before
you can run GARSP. &nbsp;The bits/map in the choose.dat file dictate the
largest bits/map setting you can use in GARSP. &nbsp;In other words, if you
downloaded a 20 bits/map version of choose.dat, you can run GARSP using 20,
19, 18 ... bits/map. &nbsp;Please refer back to the home page to get this
file.
<P>
GARSP has several command line options, and can be initiated in two ways.
&nbsp;First, GARSP can be used independent of the SAVE.TXT file to search
entire OGR's. &nbsp;This is useful to make sure you can get it up and running
easily. &nbsp;To start GARSP this way, enter the command:
<UL>
  <LI>
    GARSP 13 &nbsp; &nbsp; (To run GARSP on OGR-13)
  <LI>
    GARSP 15 &nbsp; &nbsp; (To run GARSP on OGR-15)
  <LI>
    etc etc etc
</UL>
<P>
The more useful was to run GARSP is to create a SAVE.TXT file with the desired
search range embedded in the file, and then to run GARSP with the command:
<UL>
  <LI>
    GARSP
</UL>
<P>
The SAVE.TXT file MUST contain two entries, and may contain a number more,
as follows:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Required: OGR to be searched (e.g., OGR-21 is "21")
  <LI>
    Required: Right side limit to consider (e.g., OGR-21 search limited to 332
    or less is "332"). &nbsp;Note, you may use the value "-1" here to have GARSP
    use some built in values. &nbsp;Do _not_ use "-1" for our OGR-21 search,
    since we wish to use 332 as a limit, and the built-in default is 333.
  <LI>
    Optional: A starting ruler stub, defined as a string of numbers that measure
    (1) the distance from the first mark at the left edge of the ruler to the
    second mark, (2) from the send to the third, (3) etc. &nbsp;An example is
    "1 18" to define the "stub" [1-18] which is to say that the first three marks
    are located at 0, 1 and 19 respectively.
  <LI>
    Optional: An ending ruler stub, defined as a string of (negative) numbers
    that measure (1) the distance from the first mark at the left edge of the
    ruler to the second mark, (2) from the send to the third, (3) etc. &nbsp;An
    example is "-1 -19" to define the "stub" [1-19] which is to say that GARSP
    should stop after it completes searching through the situation where the
    first three marks are located at 0, 1 and 20 respectively.
  <LI>
    NOT ALLOWED: &nbsp;Any additional entries should be made by the program,
    not by hand!
</UL>
<P>
So here is a typical example of a SAVE.TXT file, assuming you were assigned
the stub [1-18]:
<UL>
  <LI>
    SAVE.TXT contents: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21 332 1 18 -1 -18
</UL>
<P>
Of course, we added some flexibility to GARSP to handle runs without having
to duplicate the program or the choose file. &nbsp;This is done by allowing
the user to define alias paths/names to the three files used. &nbsp;The complete
command line structure of GARSP is as follows:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>
    GARSP &nbsp; [options], where [options] can include any combination of the
    following:

  Installation
</H3>
<H3>
  I - Create a directory (e.g., c:\GOLOMB21)
</H3>
<P>
To keep things simple we recommend that you create a directory for this project.
For the purposes of this documentation, we will assume that you named this
directory "GOLOMB21" (if not, just substitute the correct name).
<P>
<H3>
  II - Get the needed program files
</H3>
<P>
(Right where you got this file!)
<P>
<H3>
  III - Install an icon (Windows and OS/2 users)
</H3>
<P>
<H4>
  Win 3.x ...
</H4>
<P>
Open your "main" group and double click the icon called "pif editor". Click
on "File" / "New"
<PRE>
     Program Name     GARSP.EXE
     Window Title     Golomb Ruler
     Startup Dir      C:\GOLOMB21 (or whatever you called it)
     Display Usage    "Windowed"
     Execution        "Background"
           Note...    clicking on Exclusive lets GARSP run faster but
                      stops other app's when GARSP is in full screen mode
     Click on ADVANCED, Under "Other" click on "Allow Close When Active"
</PRE>
<P>
Click on "OK" / "File" / "Save" and save it as GOLOMB21.PIF before exiting
from the PIF Editor. The final step is to create an icon and link it to the
PIF file. To do this, decide where you want the icon. Let us suppose you
decide the "Main" group.
<PRE>
  Click once on the "Main" group.
  Click on "File", "New", "Program File"
     Description      Golomb Ruler
     Command Line     GOLOMB21.PIF
     Working Dir.     C:\GOLOMB21 (or whatever you called it)
  Click on OK
</PRE>
<P>
<H4>
  Win 95 ...
</H4>
<P>
<PRE>Click on "My Computer"
Click to the directory "C:\GOLOMB21" (or whatever you called it)
Right-click on the file called "GARSP.EXE" and select COPY
Right-click on your desktop in an empty area, and select PASTE SHORTCUT

Right-click the new shortcut icon on your desktop
Click on "Properties" and select the "Misc" tab on the far right
Click off (turn off) "Warn if still active"
When done, select OK.
</PRE>
<P>
<H4>
  OS/2 ...
</H4>
<P>
Tear off a "Program" template from your Templates Folder. On the "program"
page of the settings notebook, enter:
<PRE>
  Path and file name:    C:\GOLOMB21\GARSP.EXE  (adjust path as needed)
  Parameters:            (--none--)
  Working directory:     C:\GOLOMB21  (adjust path as needed)
</PRE>
<P>
On the "general" page, give the program object a title (e.g., "GOLOMB21")
and associate any icon you like. The defaults on the other pages are probably
appropriate, but you may change them if you like.
<P>
<H4>
  Win 3.x, Win 95, and OS/2 ...
</H4>
<P>
After you test the program, please move this icon to your startup group so
that it starts automatically! In Win 95, the startup file folder is usually
"c:\windows\start menu\programs\startup".
<P>
<H3>
  IV - Test the program
</H3>
<P>
<H4>
  - DOS &amp; OS/2
</H4>
<P>
Change into the GOLOMB21 directory and type the command GARSP 13 (in a DOS
window, for OS/2). The test should take a minute or so to complete. To stop
the test, press the "CNTL-BREAK" keys simultaneously.
<P>
<H4>
  - Windows &amp; OS/2
</H4>
<P>
Type "13 -1" into a file called SAVE.TXT in the directory where you placed
the program files. &nbsp;Then double click on the GOLOMB21 icon. You should
see the output appearing in a DOS window. To stop the test, just close the
window (yes, even if you are warned about saving data).
<P>
<H4>
  - DOS, OS/2 &amp; Windows
</H4>
<P>
When you are done testing, delete the two files in the GOLOMB21 directory
called "save.txt" and "send.txt" (more about these later).
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
<H2>
  Running GARSP
</H2>
<P>
<H3>
  Step 1 (Clearing "Send.Txt")
</H3>
<P>
The _first_ time you run the GOLOMB21 program for real, you need to delete
the file "send.txt" in your GOLOMB21 directory. It will have been created
if you ran the test cited above.
<P>
<H3>
  Step 2 (Starting Point: "Save.Txt")
</H3>
<P>
Next you need to copy the START.TXT file we sent you to SAVE.TXT (overwriting
the existing SAVE.TXT if it exists). Now just start the program (like in
the test cited above).
<P>
As noted above, you can stop a particular run at any time you want by using
the "Cntl-Break" keys, or by closing the GOLOMB21 window. When you restart
later, it will pick up where it left off. We hope that you will put the program
into Windows or OS/2 Start-Up group so that it automatically starts whenever
you start Windows.
<P>
<H3>
  Step 3 (Results)
</H3>
<P>
Periodically (every week or so ... but not any more frequently) we would
appreciate an email with the SEND.TXT file attached or embedded to the email.
When you get close to needing a new ruler stub to work on we will send a
new one with instructions. As stubs are completed, we will update the WEB
page. &nbsp;We hope to have an automated server in late February 1998, so
hopefully these procedures will change by then :)

  Special Note: Multitasking In Windows
</H3>
<P>
This program has been setup to allow you to multitask. Multitask means that
while the program is running, you can still use your computer to do other
things.
<P>
If you do not have a Pentium or better, you may want to set the priority
of the program to a low value so that you can multitask without any slowdown
in speed. To do this in Windows 3.x, use the PIF Editor (in "Main" group)
to edit the "C:\GOLOMB21.PIF" file, select "Advanced" and change the "Background
Priority" to a lower value such as 25 (seems OK on average for a 486-33).
In Windows 95, right-click on the shortcut icon, select the "Misc" tab and
move the "Idle Sensitivity" slider to the right (higher sensitivity), or
better yet, use the "idle" priority client that can be downloaded from the
web page.
<P>
To multitask, all you need to do is to start the program. After it starts,
just do whatever you would to start your other program, and GOLOMB21 will
continue running in the background.
<P>
For those of you not familiar with multitasking, here are a few good tips.
To cycle through all open applications hold down the "ALT" button and press
the "TAB" key repeatedly until you see the application you want to work in.
You can also do this in Win 3.1 by using the "CNTL" "ESC" key combo, but
it puts you directly into the Task Manager. For DOS programs like GOLOMB21,
remember you can switch from Full Screen to Windowed by using the "ALT" "ENTER"
key combo. (The GOLOMB21 program runs faster in Full Screen mode, but if
you want to shut it down, you have to switch back to Windowed mode and then
close the window).
<P>
<H3>
  About The GARSP Program
</H3>
<P>
The GARSP program was designed to allow users to interrupt it without losing
too much work, and then to pick up again later where they left off. The program
does this by storing its progress in a file called "SAVE.TXT". This file
is started at a known ruler stub, and the program then proceeds to search
from this point forward. The term "ruler stub" is defined in detail in the
GVANT program documentation, but briefly: it refers to a particular combination
for the first 5 or so marks on the ruler.
<P>
The program outputs results to both the screen and to the SAVE.TXT file.
What you'll see on the screen is a summary of each ruler stub being tested,
with the following items:
<PRE>
  1. The number of tick marks (in our case, 21)
  2. The shortest known GOLOMB Ruler for that # of tick marks (333 so far)
  3. The ruler stub's first 5 tick mark locations (e.g., 1 3 5 7, with "0" also assumed)
  4. The number of seconds it took to solve the ruler stub (usually 0-10,000)
  5. The number of nodes it took to test this ruler stub (multiply this by 10^6).
  6. The number of nodes it took to test this ruler stub (add this to above).
</PRE>
<P>
As you see the stubs being output to the screen, glance at the second item
(333 for a 21 mark ruler). We have arbitrarily decided to limit our search
to 332, since we wish to "beat" 333! &nbsp;If you see this drop to 331 or
less, EMAIL US IMMEDIATELY. Your program has found a shorter 21-mark ruler
than any such ruler previously found! We want to know about such discoveries
as soon as possible as the information can be used to speed up the search
for other starting ruler stubs which have yet to be tested.
<P>
Also, note that it is up to you as to when to send results back to us. We
would prefer that you run an entire ruler stub (e.g., if you started with
0 1 3 0 0, the stub is completed as soon as the "3" changes to a "4"). This
can take a week or more depending on
<PRE>
  *  Your machine speed
  *  How long you keep your PC running (all night?)
  *  If you are multitasking in Windows
  *  What ruler stub you are working on.  
</PRE>
<P>
We can send you simpler stubs at first to let you determine how difficult
a stub you really want to work on.
<P>
When a stub is completed, please EMAIL us a copy of the "SEND.TXT" file with
the phrase "SEND.TXT" in the comment field.
<P>
For those who are inquisitive about the send.txt file, please refer to the
program to see how progress is stored along with any found rulers. The rulers
are always stored on a single line beginning with a zero. If you don't see
any ... don't worry, chances are only one or maybe two of us will find one
for the OGR-21 ruler! &nbsp;BTW, as a safety precaution, newly found rulers
are also stored in a second file called "newruler.txt".
