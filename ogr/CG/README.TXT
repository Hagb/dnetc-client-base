Welcome to the newest beta of GARSP.  We call this version
"ChoosyGARSP" because it incorporates the choose data internally,
and is thus a combined version of CHOOSE.C and GARSP.C.

It is a work in construction at the moment, but is already so
far beyond GARSP 5.13 that we will almost certainly be switching
to the latest release for future OGR searches.

By work in construction, we mean that there are several major advances
that will probably be incorporated, but that the basics for a new
program have already been laid down in this version.

We need some help in preparing for a more general release, and are
looking for anything you may find.  Feel free to test, attempt to
cause errors, compare to GARSP 5.13 (maybe even on the same stubs
you tested in the OGR-21 search?) ... whatever you feel like over
the next few days.

After some feedback, we'll try to incorporate a few more changes, and
have a more structured beta test. Please note that we don't want this
beta version widely distributed yet ... doing so could cause too much
confusion until after the improvements/fixes have all been integrated.

The program runs the same as the old GARSP did, and uses the same input
files and formats.  The intermediate file saves are a little different,
so you cannot run a stub partially with the old GARSP and then resume
with this version. (That doesn't count as "causing an error! LOL)

The included CG_BETA.C and GARSP.TXT files are (1) source code
and (2) comments on the improvements made.  If you do not have
a compiler, let us know and we can forward an executable (but let
us know what platform you're running on ... Win95, OS/2, etc)

At the moment, "we" refers to Oliver Wiedemann and Mark Garry (me).
We have both been heavy into program alterations, although
Oliver is clearly a leader for the current release and may be able
to answer technical questions a bit more accurately.  Fairly soon,
the "we" will include D.Net, with resources of about 30,000 CPUs ...
so if that makes you feel special, good  ;-)

We're looking forward to your comments!  (Especialy the good ones,
but we need the bad ones too, to make all this better)
