       detached - this is really the wrong place to do this.
       The client should run detached only if either --hide or
       ini.runhidden=1, neither of which are known at the time this
       function is called. (btw: a "-quiet" found on the command line
       prior to calling this determines that *the installation* should
       be quiet, not the run)
       - EMX could just fork() [same code section in cmdline.cpp as all
       the other unix clients]
       - non-emx could choose to simply spawn
       "CMD.EXE PARAMETERS=/c detach RC5DES.EXE -svcrun ..."
       where "-svcrun" is simply a hack to ensure that it doesn't spawn
       itself in a loop. (of course, if we can detect if the client is
       already loaded, or already detached, then we don't need -svcrun)
