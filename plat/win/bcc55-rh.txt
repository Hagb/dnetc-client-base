# As of Feb 2000, Borland C++ 5.5 compiler is free for download.
# http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/
# ftp://ftpd.inprise.com/download/bcppbuilder/FreeCommandLineTools.exe
#
# however, the Borland C++ 5.5 initial public release does not
# include any of the include\*.rh files necessary to compile resources.
#
# Workaround: unzip bcc55-rh.zip to bccinstallpath\include.
# The zip contains four one-line xxx.rh files including the xxx.h file.
# This is enough to compile the client's .res file.
