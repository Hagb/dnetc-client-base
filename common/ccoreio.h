 * Parameter/Result definitions for crypto cores:
 * Caution: ******** this header is used from C source ************
 *
 * Crypto cores take a RC5UnitWork struct as an argument, and 
 * a) [obsolete] return the number of keys they checked in that call
 * b) [TODO] return one of the result codes defined in the ResultCode enum
 *
 * The ideal core prototype is:
 * extern s32 (*core)(RC5UnitWork *, u32 *timeslice, void *scratch_area );
 * - which returns a ResultCode member, or 0xffffffff (-1) if error
 * - timeslice is a *pointer*. On input this is the number of timeslices to 
 *   do, and on return it contains the number of timeslices done. This may be 
 *   greater than the number requested.
 * - scratch_area is a membuffer of core dependant size. This buffer is part 
 *   of the problem object (ie created when the object is new'd)
