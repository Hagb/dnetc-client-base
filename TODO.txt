This file contains a list of mini-projects. Submissions as well as 
volunteers :) are welcome. 

The list is maintained by Cyrus "cyp" Patel <cyp@fb14.uni-mainz.de>. 
To avoid having the wheel reinvented, please holler if you wish
to tackle a project.

If you have the expertise but lack the time to handle a project, 
please post your willingness to assist to coders@. Perhaps someone 
else has what you don't. :)


1. Add support for GSSAPI authentication to the client's SOCKS5 handler.
   GSSAPI support is *required* according to the SOCKS5 rfc. Priority: Medium

2. Clean up the cores.                                       Priority: HIGH
   a) The ideal prototype for any core, regardless of project,
      s32 (*core_unit)( RC5unitWork *, u32 *timeslice, void *membuff );
      1) it does its own pre- and post-incrementation, 
      2) timeslice to 'nbits' ('nodes') conversion, 
      3) store the effective timeslice back in *timeslice
      4) return a rescode == RESULT_[FOUND|NOTHING|WORKING] or -1 if error
      Also note that the call is to a function pointer that is selected
      in Problem::LoadState() based on contest number and cputype. 
   b) Clean up "ANSI" core(s) 
      a) get rid of the RC5CORE stuff from ./configure
      b) rename the cores from [rc5|des]_unit_func to 
         [rc5|des]_ansi_[x]_unit_func 
      c) fix the cores to use timeslice

3. Devise and write a better filebuffer scheme.            Priority: Low
   a) better "locking". The current method of writing 0x1 to tag
      a file as 'locked' is not ideal. Using a specific value to 
      identify the lock as the client's own would probably solve
      all locking problems.
   b) contain both in and completed blocks in a single file. Even 
      better would be a format that accomodates blocks from all 
      projects.
   c) The buffer format must support FIFO. The current FIFO scheme 
      uses a "find one more suitable than default" scheme. It works 
      well and has a low overhead. 

4. Write a routine to import/export uuencoded buffers for/from users
   that can only update their buffers via mail.            Priority: Medium
        
5. Add FTP as a supported buffer exchange protocol. The client could
   directly STOR buff-in.xx and requests to RETR rc5 would cause the
   keyserver to return a rc5 block from its ready queue.   Priority: Low
    
6. Write a small routine to obtain a list of the local host's UP af_inet 
   if's by using SNMP or ... Use ioctl() to do the same (for your port).                                                                   Priority: Low
