Supplement to
BrydDES Key Search Library, version 1.01.

BDESLW1.S Small Core, AT&T assembler format. Marked Core 1d.
BDESLOW.S Large Core, AT&T assembler format. Marked Core 2d.

The two cores could be combined into one file with defines,
but that is not done yet.

Also I have not tested if these versions are more sensitive
to the Windows 95 speed issue and I have not optimized code
alignment. So for now I would use the AT&T versions where
needed for porting.

In the process of testing the code converting, I noted that
the GAS assembler produces 3 byte encodings for ror reg,1
(and rol, shl, shr) This might confuse code alignment
optimizations. Also the GAS code for ror/rol,1 cannot be
paired on the Pentium, which could influence other cores.
