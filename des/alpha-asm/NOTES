	This is the start of the Digital Unix multicore/multiprocessor
	solution.  Unfortunately I am convinced the fast
	deseval-dworz3.S is not reentrant and therefore can't be used
	in the multithreaded version.  The multithreaded version is
	therefore using the same core for both EV4 and EV5 processors
	which is the fastest reentrant core for them both.
